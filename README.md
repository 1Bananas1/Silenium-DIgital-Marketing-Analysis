Must have a gamelytics.net account. When done, put in user and pass where var is defined. 

getData2 goes through all the possible combinations for each possibility 'test' times. Post length can be changed to whatever want tested.

getMax goes through what I found to give the most optimal data, however it is entirely luck based in trying to maximize the impressions hence why it runs 7,500 times.
